# LargeScaleStructure
*Improving data analysis and inference in large-scale structure (LSS)
and baryon acoustic feature (BAO) projects.*

Current large-scale structure projects make use of either heuristic estimators
or else artificial likelihood functions built from estimated two-point (variance) information.
Here we explore methods for getting closer to something
that represents the probability of the data given the cosmological parameters.
